### Sorting Algorithms :
 * Selection Sort : 
    - Selection sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly selects the minimum element from an unsorted  list and places it at the beginning of the list.
* Bubble Sort :
    - Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
* Insertion Sort :
    - Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time by comparing each element with the previous elements and swapping them if they are in the wrong order.
